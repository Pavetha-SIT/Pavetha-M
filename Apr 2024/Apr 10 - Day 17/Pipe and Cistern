1.Two pipes A and B can fill a cistern in 37 minutes and 45 minutes respectively. Both pipes are opened. The cistern will be filled in just half an hour, if the B is turned off after:
A.5 min      B. 9 min       C. 10 min           D. 15 min.
Ans:
A can fill the tank = 1/37
B can fill the tank = 1/45
A's 30  = 30/37
 Rem work = 1- 30/37 = 7/37
         = 45 * 7/37 
         = 8.5 
Answer = 9

2.Two outlet pipes A and B are connected to a full tank. Pipe A alone can empty the tank in 10 minutes and pipe B alone can empty the tank in 30 minutes. If both are opened together, how much time will it take to empty the tank completely?
A.7 minutes       B.7 minutes 30 seconds          C.6 minutes            D.6 minutes 3 seconds
Ans:
A can fill the tank = 1/10
B can fill the tank = 1/30
A + B = 1/10 + 1/30 = 4/30
30/4 = 7.5
Answer = 7 minutes 30 seconds
