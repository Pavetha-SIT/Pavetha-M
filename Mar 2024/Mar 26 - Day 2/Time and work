1.Amruta can do a piece of work in 20 days.Narendra is 25% more efficient than Amruta.  The number of days taken by Narendra to do the same piece of work in?

a.15 days        b.16 days       c.18 days        d.20 days

solution

narendra 25% of 20 less than amruta
              25% of 20 is 5 .. 20-5 
ans=15days

2.A can finish a work in 24 dyas B in 9 days and C in 12 days.   B and c start the work but are forced to leave after 3 days. The remaining work was done by A is?
Option:
a.5 days      b.6 days      c.10 days      d.11 days

LCM of 24,9,12 is 216
A's efficiency 216/24=9
B's efficiency 216/9=24
C's efficiency 216/12=18
B and C start the work so efficiency of B+C is 24+18=42 for 3 days 3*42=126
B & C work together is 126.
Then remaining work is 216-126=90
A's work remaining work/efficiency of A=90/9=10 days
ans=10days
