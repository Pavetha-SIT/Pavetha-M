1.In the beginning, Ram works at a rate such that he can finish a piece of work in 24 hrs, but he only works at this rate for 16 hrs.
After that, he works at a rate such that he can do the whole work in 18 hrs. If Ram is to finish this work at a stretch, how many hours will he take to finish this work?
a.12 hrs         b.18 hrs         c.11Â½ hrs         d.15 hrs          e.22 hrs
ans
16/24 = 2/3 work completed in 16hrs
1/3 remaining work = 1/3 *18 
                   =  6hrs 
total = 16+6 
      = 22hrs
Ans: 22hrs

2.A can do a piece of work in 10 days, and B can do the same work in 20 days. With the help of C, they finished the work in 4 days. C can do the work in how many days, working alone?
a.5 days         b.10 days         c.15 days          d.20 days           e.25 days
ans

Lcm of 10 and 20 is 20
Efficiency of A=2
Efficiency of B=1
total work =20 
total efficiency = 20/4
                 = 5
the efficiency of c = 2 (2+1+2=5)
work done by c alone = 20/2 = 10days
Ans: 10days
