1. Anil and Bhaskar can do a piece of work individually in 12 and 20 days respectively. They work together for 6 days before Anil decides to leave. How many days will it take Bhaskar to complete the work on his own?
A. 4             B. 14            C. 6              D. 3
ans
LCM of 12 and 20 is 60  -> total work
A's efficiency = 5 and B's efficiency = 3
Ratio = 5:3
work done = 8 *6 
          = 48 
remaining work = 60-48
               = 12   
B = 12/3  
  = 4 days 
Ans: 4 days

2. Dilip and Samrat can do a piece of work in 16 days and 24 days respectively. Samrat works alone for 15 days and leaves. In how many days can Dilip complete the remaining work?
A. 8  B. 10  C. 6  D. 7
ans
LCM of 16 and 24 is 48
dilip's eff = 3
samrit's eff = 2
samrit works = 15*2
             = 30
dilip works = 48-30
            = 18/3 
            = 6 days
Ans : 6 days
